# ddb-dm-screen

## description

This Tampermonkey userscript aims to provide simple DM screen by extracting json-formatted character data. For it to work, user must be a DM owning the campaign, otherwise no access to character's JSON data is possible.

## usage

1. Install tampermonkey
2. unstall new script from below link: https://github.com/mivalsten/ddb-dm-screen/raw/master/ddb-dm-screen.user.js
3. It autoupdates, yay

## security

Remember to never paste unknown userscripts from some shady github repos to your tampermonkey addon as this can severely compromise your PC. And especially never use autoupdate feature without reviewing contents of the changes added to the script. Generally, write your own userscripts if you can.
